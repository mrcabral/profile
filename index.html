        <p>  I studied Forest Engineering, and worked in the sector for
         about 6 years. But the last two years I have been working in the Scuba Diving
         industry as a Divemaster. Diving is alot of fun but id like to keep practicing
         it mostly as a hobby.</p>
         <p>As for forestry, I love nature but the jobs are not as
         interesting as I thought they would be, even though I had some great experiences.
         I always thought about hoping into IT and recently I discovered programming and
         I thought it should be a really interesting path to follow. If I link it or not
         with my "biology" background we will see.</p>
         <p>Id like to try and experience different
         things, but mostly, keep learning.</p>
